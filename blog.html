            <!-- question 1 -->
            <h2 class="text-pink-600 text-xl font-medium pb-4">Question 1: Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.
            </h2>
            <h2 class="text-xl"><span class="text-blue-700 text-xl">ans 1:</span>
                In JavaScript, var, let, and const are used to declare variables, but they have different scopes and
                behaviors. Let's discuss the scope of each: <br>
                <span class="font-semibold">var scope</span>- <br>
                If a var variable is declared inside a function, it is accessible anywhere within that function.
                Variables declared with var are also hoisted to the top of their scope, meaning they are moved to the
                top of their containing function or the global scope during the compilation phase. <br>

                <span class="font-semibold">let scope-</span> <br>
                They are only accessible within the block they are declared in, whether it's a loop, conditional
                statement, or a function.
                let variables are not hoisted to the top of their scope. They are only accessible after the declaration
                statement. <br>

                <span class="font-semibold">const scope-</span> <br>
                The key difference is that once a value is assigned to a const variable, it cannot be reassigned.
                However, this doesn't mean the value is immutable. If the value is an object, its properties can still
                be modified.
                const variables must be assigned a value when declared; they cannot be left uninitialized.

            <!-- question 2 -->
            <h2 class="text-pink-600 text-xl font-medium pt-4 pb-4">Question 2: Tell us the use cases of null and
                undefined.</h2>
            <h2 class="text-xl"><span class="text-blue-700 text-xl">ans 2:</span>
                null and undefined are two distinct values in JavaScript that indicate the absence of a meaningful
                value, but they are used in slightly different contexts. Here are their common use cases: <br>
                <span class="font-semibold">undefined:</span> <br>

               1. Variable Initialization: If you declare a variable but don't assign any value to it, it will hold the
                value undefined by default. <br>
                2. Function Return: If a function does not explicitly return a value, it implicitly returns undefined. <br> <br>

                <span class="font-semibold">null:</span> <br>
                1. Explicit Absence of Value: Unlike undefined, null is typically used to explicitly indicate that a variable or object property has no value or is empty. <br>
                2. Comparison for Intentional Absence: In some cases, developers use null as a specific value for comparison or to check for the absence of an expected value. <br>

            <!-- question 3 -->
            <h2 class="text-pink-600 text-xl font-medium pt-4 pb-4">Question 3: What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
            <h2 class="text-xl"><span class="text-blue-700 text-xl">ans 3:</span>
                REST stands for "Representational State Transfer." It's an architectural style and a set of constraints for designing networked applications, especially web services. A RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) is a type of API that adheres to the principles and constraints of the REST architecture. <br>
                <span class="font-semibold">1. Uniform Interface:</span>  REST APIs have a consistent and uniform way of accessing resources (data). This is achieved through standard HTTP methods like GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT (update), and DELETE (remove). <br>
                <span class="font-semibold">2. Caching:</span> Responses from a RESTful API can be cached to improve performance and reduce the need for redundant requests. <br>
                <span class="font-semibold">3. Representation:</span>  Data is transferred between the client and server in a specific format, often JSON or XML. This format represents the state of the resource being requested or manipulated.
